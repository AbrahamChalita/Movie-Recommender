# Movie-Recommender
With the help of the C++ object-oriented capability, this recommender system was built taking into account that the system should be able to recommend either movies or series, based on the following parameters: 

-Keyword 
-Genre 
-Rating 
-Specific Title 
-Years (combining specific year and range of years across two specific or from/under from one) 

For the construction of the recommender, three databases from three streaming platforms currently leading the market were considered. It was decided to use databases containing data and movies from the platforms of: Disney+, Netflix and CrunchyRoll, through the Kaggle page. The construction process began with the identification of the objects that make up the system and their characteristics.
